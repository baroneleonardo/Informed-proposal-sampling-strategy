# BNP-Change-Point-Functional
Project of Bayesian Statistics Course 

Starting from the code that allows to replicate the simulative results obtained in the paper *"Bayesian nonparametric change point detection for multivariate time series with missing observations"*.


The process is divided in files as following: 

  - files *"01_funzioni_log_fun_art_miss"*, *02_verosomiglianza_log_fun_art_miss"* and *"03_alpha_log_fun_art_miss"* contain the R functions 
  - *"wade.cpp"* and *"cpp_funz.cpp"* contain the C++ functions 
  - *"043_algoritmo_log_fun_art_miss_50rip"* is the main code
